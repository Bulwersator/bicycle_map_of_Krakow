weird cycleway value : cycleway AND NOT cycleway=lane AND NOT cycleway=opposite_lane AND NOT cycleway=no AND NOT cycleway=opposite
weird bicycle value : bicycle AND NOT bicycle=yes AND NOT bicycle=no AND NOT bicycle = designated AND NOT bicycle = dismount
no_and_yes_bug : __cycleable AND bicycle=no
crossing_as_way_rather_than_node_bug : highway = crossing
no oneway for bicycle instead of opposite_lane : "oneway:bicycle" = "no" AND NOT cycleway=opposite_lane
no_surface_info : __cycleable AND NOT __typical_road AND (__no_surface_info_for_main_part AND __no_surface_info_for_lane)

proper cycleway : __cycleway AND __proper_surface
proper cycleway maybe with a bad surface : __cycleway
lame cycleway : ((bicycle=designated OR (highway=cycleway AND bicycle = yes)) AND NOT segregated = yes)
contraflow : cycleway=opposite_lane
bicycle allowed : (bicycle=yes) AND NOT __typical_road
dismount from bicycle : bicycle=dismount
unexpected cycling ban : bicycle=no AND __typical_road
