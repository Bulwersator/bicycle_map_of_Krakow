This project is a tool to process data from OpenStreetMap into map about cycling infrastructure in city Krak√≥w, using program Maperitive. It may be useful for other locations but it is untested.

Retrieving mapa data fetches 140MB file. From http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API - "You can safely assume that you don't disturb other users when you do less than 10.000 queries per day or download less than 5 GB data per day.").

1a) to download map using ruby script:

run download.rb.

1b) to fetch map data without installed ruby:

Open http://overpass-api.de/query_form.html in web browser and paste following code in the first textarea:

(
  node(50,19.78,50.11,20.09);
  <;
);
out meta;

and press Querry. Name obtained file interpreter.osm and move to the repository.

2) To see map: run Maperitive.exe in folder Maperitive.

3) to modify rendering rules. Requires Ruby.

modify generate.rb and run generate.bat to generate a new version of .mrules files
